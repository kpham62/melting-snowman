# Melting Snowman

Group Members: Cynthia Lopez, Thomas Huynh, Kenny Pham

Class: CSCI 143 Obj-Orient Prog II with Java

School: Highline College

Professor: Nizami, Syeda

Our game is called Melting Snowman, modified from the classic game "hangman". Users will start out with a fully built snowman. Users will then answer math problems and each time they get a math problem wrong, one part of the snowman will melt.

- If the user keeps getting answers wrong, they will eventually melt the entire snowman and will fail the game.

- If they successfully answer the math problem, the snowman will not melt and they will succeed in keeping the snowman from melting. The user can then close the game and run the program again to keep playing.
