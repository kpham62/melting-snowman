# melting-snowman

Group Members: Cynthia Lopez, Kenny Pham, Thomas Huynh

Our game is called Melting Snowman, modified from the classic game "hangman". Users will start out with a fully built snowman. Users will then answer math problems and each time they get a math problem wrong, one part of the snowman will melt.

- If the user keeps getting answers wrong, they will eventually melt the entire snowman and will fail the game.

- If they successfully answer the math problem, the snowman will not melt and they will succeed in keeping the snowman from melting. After correctly answering the math problem, confetti will fall signifying a win, and the user will be given an option to reset the game.
